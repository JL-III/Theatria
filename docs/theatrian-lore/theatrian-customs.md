# Theatrian Customs

Life on Theatria is harsh, strange, and unpredictable. Over time, Theatrians have adopted a series of customs—some born from survival, others from whimsy—that mark them as part of this world. These aren’t rules, but shared habits that bind the community together in an unspoken way.

Here are a few customs you might notice… or choose to adopt yourself:

***

#### 🏆 The GG Ritual

Whether it’s a player leveling up, surviving a close encounter, or finishing a build, Theatrians say “gg”—good game. It’s a universal way of showing respect for small victories, even in a world where survival is never guaranteed.

***

#### 🔑 The WB Greeting

When a player logs back in, Theatrians greet them with a simple “wb”—welcome back. It’s a small way to say: _you made it back alive_.

***

#### 🥔 The Void Potato Offering

When the resource worlds reset, Theatrians gather at the void and toss in a potato as an offering. It’s said to “feed the emptiness” and bless their next adventure with good luck.

***

#### 🦴 The Bone Toss

After defeating a mob in a tough fight, Theatrians sometimes toss a bone onto the ground—an offering to the Bone God in thanks for survival. Superstition holds that watching the bone despawn brings good luck, as if the Bone God has accepted the gift.

***

#### 🌙 The Whisper Game

When a player logs out, it’s customary for others to quietly say, “rest well” after they leave. It’s part respect, part superstition.

***

#### 🌊 The Goo!

Every so often, out of nowhere, someone shouts **Goo!** in chat. There’s no context, no explanation—just Goo. And sometimes, others will join in.

It’s a Theatrian thing—an odd little spark that reminds us we’re all in this together.

But here’s the secret: **Goo is only special because it’s rare.** If you shout it too often, it loses its magic—and nobody wants that. (Also: don’t spam.)

These customs aren’t mandatory, but they’re part of what makes Theatria feel alive. Whether you join in or just observe, know that you’re part of the story here.
