# Land Claiming



### Claiming:

To make a claim you will first stand in the area you would like to claim, then use /claim. Claims are done on a per chunk basis (16x16 blocks). You will need money to make a claim. There are several ways to make money as shows in the [Economy](https://docs.playtheatria.com/economy) section of this wiki. Chunk claiming is limited by [ranks](https://docs.playtheatria.com/ranks), to increase the amount you can claim all you need to do is [rank](https://docs.playtheatria.com/ranks) up!\
