# Warps

Warps are teleport points available to all players on Theatria. They provide an easy way to travel across the server without the need to walk long distances.

## How to Use Warps

To view the list of available warps, use the command:

```
/warps
```

This will display all the warps currently accessible to you. To teleport to a specific warp, simply select it from the menu.

## Warp Categories

Warps on Theatria are organized into the following categories:

- **Server:** Key locations maintained by the server, such as spawn points and event areas.
- **Town:** Teleport points for various player-created towns and communities.
- **Shop:** Locations for player shops where you can buy and sell items.
- **Farm:** Designated areas for resource gathering, like mob farms and crop fields.
- **Other:** Miscellaneous warps that donâ€™t fit into the above categories.

## Warp Costs

Most warps are free to use. However, some warps may have a Denarii cost associated with them. To find out if a warp costs Denarii, hover over it in the warp menu to see its details.

## Unlocking Additional Warps

As you progress through ranks on Theatria, you'll unlock the ability to purchase and create additional community warps. This feature allows you to set up convenient teleport points for others to use, fostering collaboration and ease of travel.
