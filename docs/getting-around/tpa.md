# Using the /tpa Command

The `/tpa` command and related commands make it easy to move around Theatria when you're playing with friends or meet someone new in chat. These commands are a great way to connect and explore together.

## How to Use `/tpa`

### Sending a Teleport Request
To visit another player at their location, you can send a `/tpa` request. For example:

```plaintext
/tpa BobaTheTurtle
```

This sends a request to the player "BobaTheTurtle" letting them know you want to teleport to their location. The player will receive a message and can choose to accept or deny your request.

### Accepting a Request
If someone sends you a `/tpa` request, you’ll see a notification in chat. To allow them to teleport to you, type:

```plaintext
/tpaccept
```

Once you accept, the requesting player will be teleported to your location.

### Denying a Request
If you receive a `/tpa` request that you don't want to accept, you can simply ignore it, or you can explicitly reject it by typing:

```plaintext
/tpdeny
```

This will notify the player that their teleport request has been denied.

## Additional Commands

### `/tpahere`
If you want to request that another player teleports to your location, you can use the `/tpahere` command. For example:

```plaintext
/tpahere BobaTheTurtle
```

This sends a request asking the player "BobaTheTurtle" to teleport to you. They can accept or deny the request in the same way as a `/tpa` request.

### `/tpcancel`
If you change your mind after sending a `/tpa` or `/tpahere` request, you can cancel it before the other player responds by typing:

```plaintext
/tpcancel
```

This prevents the request from being accepted.

### `/tpaccept` Timeout
Requests will time out after a short period if the other player doesn’t respond. You’ll need to resend the request if it expires.

## Best Practices
- **Ask for Permission First**: It’s polite to ask in chat if someone is okay with you sending a `/tpa` request before you send it.
- **Be Patient**: Give the other player time to respond. They might be busy or in the middle of something.
- **Respect Denials**: If a player denies your request, don’t repeatedly send it. This can be seen as spamming and may result in penalties.

## Common Issues

### I Can’t Send Requests
Check if you’re in an area where teleport commands are restricted, or if you’re experiencing server lag. Also, ensure the other player hasn’t blocked teleport requests.

### My Request Was Ignored
The other player might be busy or away from their keyboard. Consider asking them in chat if they’re available to accept a teleport request.
