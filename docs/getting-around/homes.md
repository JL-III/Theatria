# Homes

In Theatria, you can save and return to your favorite locations using the **/home** system. Homes are personal teleport points that make it easy to revisit special places in the world, whether it's your cozy base, a beautiful landscape, or a convenient spot for resources.

## Viewing Your Homes

To view all of the homes you've saved, use the following command:

```
/homes
```

This will display a list of all your current homes, allowing you to select and teleport to them.

## Saving Homes

As a new player, you can save up to **2 homes**. Additional homes can be unlocked as you rank up within the server. Homes can be saved in **any dimension**, giving you maximum flexibility to explore and build wherever you like.

To save a home at your current location, use the following command:

```
/sethome <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with a unique name for your home, such as "base," "village," or "mine."

## Teleporting to a Home

To teleport to a saved home, use:

```
/home <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with the name of the home you want to visit.

## Important Notes

- **Only you can use your homes.** Other players cannot access your teleport points.
- **Setting a home does not claim or protect land.** It only creates a teleport point. To secure your builds, read about [land claiming](link-to-land-claiming-page).
