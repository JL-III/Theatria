# Meteorites

Get there with '/warp mining'

Meteorites are special events in the [Mining World](worlds-dimensions/mining.md). These fiery objects fall from the sky at random intervals, bringing opportunities for treasure and danger alike.

## How to Find Meteorites

Keep an eye on the chat! When a meteorite lands, you'll see a message with approximate coordinates. Use these clues to track down the landing site and uncover its secrets.

## Treasure and Danger

Meteorites often contain barrels with valuable treasures, but beware â€” they may be guarded by powerful mobs! Make sure you're prepared before venturing to claim your rewards.
