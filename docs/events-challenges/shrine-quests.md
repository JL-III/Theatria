## What are Shrine Quests?

Shrine Quests are daily tasks that consist of two distinct parts:

1. **Action Phase:** Engage in activities like mining, fishing, or chopping wood in the `/warp mining` world.
2. **Delivery Phase:** Return resources obtained during the action phase to the Oracle's shrine at `/warp shrine` in The Ark.

For help navigating these areas, refer to the [**Getting Around**](../getting-around/README.md) section of the wiki.

## Starting a Shrine Quest

Players are automatically enrolled in Shrine Quests upon logging in. Notifications about your progress appear as a green chat message indicating the tasks remaining, such as:

> "x blocks left to break."

## Monitoring Your Quest Progress

You can check your quest progress anytime by using the `/shrine` command. This command opens a menu displaying your current quest details:

- **Action Requirements:** The activity you need to complete in the `/warp mining` world.
- **Item Requirements:** The resource(s) you must bring to the shrine at `/warp shrine` in The Ark.

## Completing a Shrine Quest

To complete a Shrine Quest:

1. Finish the action phase in the `/warp mining` world as described in your quest.
2. Deliver the required item(s) to the Oracle's shrine at `/warp shrine` in The Ark.

**Note:** The shrine will only accept items after the action phase is completed. For help navigating, check out the [**Getting Around**](../getting-around/README.md) section of the wiki.
