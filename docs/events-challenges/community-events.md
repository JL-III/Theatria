# Community Events

Community events are a great way to connect with other players, showcase your creativity, and enjoy everything Theatria has to offer as a community. Events often start in [Discord](https://discord.gg/SHgauw8eN8), and everyone is encouraged to participate or contribute their ideas.

## How to Get Involved

### Suggest an Event
- **Join our Discord**: Start by joining Theatria's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SHgauw8eN8) if you haven't already. This is where event planning begins.
- **Share your idea**: Use the **#suggestions** channel to propose your event. Provide details such as:
  - Event name
  - Goals or activities
  - Date and time (or a range of possible dates)
  - Any resources or permissions needed

### Join an Event
- **Check for announcements**: Look for upcoming events announced in the **#announcements** channel on Discord. Player-run events will be announced in global channels.

- **Show up and have fun**: Be ready to participate on the Minecraft server at the scheduled time.

## Hosting Your Own Event

1. **Get approval**: Submit your event proposal in the **#suggestions** channel for feedback and approval by the community moderators.
2. **Plan the event**: Make sure you have all necessary resources, permissions, and any technical requirements sorted out.
3. **Spread the word**: Once your event is ready, you can share it with the community by mentioning it in global channels like **#general** at reasonable, non-spammy intervals. Remember to keep your announcements polite and informative to encourage participation!
4. **Run your event**: Be prepared to lead your event, manage participants, and have fun with your fellow players!
