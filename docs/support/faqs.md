# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Gameplay Features

### Are mods or resource packs required?
No mods are required to play on Theatria. However, our custom resource pack is mandatory for the best experience. Please ensure you have "Server Resource Packs" set to **Enabled** in your Minecraft settings when joining.

### Can I claim land to protect my builds?
Yes! Theatria has a robust [land-claim system](../gameplay-features/land-claiming.md) that allows you to protect your builds from griefing. Additionally, you can use our [chest locks](../gameplay-features/chest-locks.md) feature to secure your chests and containers.

## Community and Rules

### What are the server rules?
Our rules are designed to foster a fun, inclusive, and respectful environment for all players. Please take a moment to review the full list of [Rules & Policies](../rules-policies/README.md).

### Why do some players glow?
The glowing effect indicates that the player has activated Night Vision. This feature is unlocked at [Champion rank](../gameplay-features//ranks/mythic-tier/02-champion.md) and allows players to toggle the `/nv` command. Night Vision provides a glowing aura and improved visibility in dark areas.

### How do I fly?
Flying is a special perk unlocked at the Contributor+ [supporter rank](../gameplay-features/feature-shop.md) or higher. Once unlocked, you can toggle flight using the `/fly` command.

### What are the numbers I see above some mobs in the Mining world?
Those numbers represent a stack of mobs! Theatria uses a [mob stacking](../gameplay-features/mob-stacking.md) plugin to optimize performance and reduce lag by grouping mobs together.

### Help! I'm stuck somewhere in game and can't escape!
Never fear! Use one of your saved [Homes](../getting-around/homes.md), a [Warp](../getting-around//warps.md), sending a [/tpa request](../getting-around/tpa.md) to another player, or try the command `/unstuck`.

## Technical Questions

### What versions of Minecraft are supported?
Theatria is currently running on **Minecraft 1.21.1**. While players on other versions may be able to connect, we only provide support for the current version.

### Iâ€™m experiencing lag. What can I do?
Lag can occur for various reasons. Here are a few steps you can take to improve your performance:
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
- Allocate more RAM to Minecraft via the launcher settings.
- Use performance-enhancing tools like OptiFine or Sodium.
- Lower your video settings (e.g., render distance, graphics quality).

If the issue persists, reach out for assistance in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SHgauw8eN8).

### Can I play on Theatria using a Bedrock/Console version of Minecraft?
