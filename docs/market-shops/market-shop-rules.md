# Market Shop Rules

Market shop requirements:

* Players with market plots must maintain activity by logging in at least once a month.
* Keep their shop chests stocked.
* Keep a minimum of ten shop chests.
* Must have a structure for the shop. This is to keep the market looking interesting.

Failure to do so may result in the loss of the market shop or a notice & 100,000 fine for rule violation.
