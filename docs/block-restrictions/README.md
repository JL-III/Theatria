# Block Restrictions

To ensure the integrity and stability of our server, we have certain server-wide restrictions on some blocks. These restrictions are in place to prevent potential exploitation and to discourage practices that could negatively impact server performance.

### Server-Wide Restricted Block

* **Slime Block:** Slime Blocks are restricted server-wide due to potential exploits and the possibility of creating machines that can cause server instability.&#x20;

Remember, the aim of these restrictions is to ensure fair gameplay for all players and to maintain a healthy server environment.
