# The Moon Restrictions

Maintaining a fair gameplay and preserving server health are our top priorities. We've set several block restrictions on The Moon to avoid the potential misuse of game mechanics that might cause server lag. The following blocks are restricted:

### Redstone-Related Items

* Hopper Minecart
* Observer
* Piston
* Sticky Piston
* Hopper
* Slime Block

### Explosive Items

* TNT
* TNT Minecart

### Beds

Usage and placement of beds of any color are restricted.

These restrictions have been put in place to ensure the best gameplay experience and to avoid any potential server issues. Automation is discouraged on The Moon, and the focus should be more on exploration and survival. Please review this list before planning any activities on The Moon.
