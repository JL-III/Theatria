# Banned player lock removals

## Temp bans

**Locks that belong to a temp banned players are not available for lock removals while their ban is running it's course.** \
This means they are still protected by the **/seen** rule found in [claim-maintenance-and-expiration-notice.md](../land-claiming/claim-maintenance-and-expiration-notice.md "mention")

## All other bans

All other bans have one week to [submit an appeal](../ban-appeals.md) before their locks are eligible for removal.

A player's locks cannot be removed during this week, or during the time period for which the appeal is under consideration.

Open a lock removal request in our discord under [support.md](../support.md "mention")
