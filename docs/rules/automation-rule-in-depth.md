# Automation Rule in Depth

Automation for collecting drops or making money is not allowed.\
Red stone mechanisms are allowed, primarily they are used for things like auto-smelters, door mechanisms, sorters etc.&#x20;

If you have questions on what is allowed always feel free to open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz) in discord, we are happy to help clarify anything.\
\
The following items are blacklisted for hoppers and pistons (meaning they will not work):

* PUMPKIN
* MELON
* SUGAR\_CANE
* BAMBOO
* CACTUS
* WHEAT

Anyone who is caught automating money making methods is at risk of an account wipe (balance removed, ranks removed) and audit (investigation into money distribution and earnings). **JUST DONT DO IT**



**Mods:**

Autofishing mods are allowed, **HOWEVER** you must always be able to pass an afk check.&#x20;

If you are afk when an afk check happens your account **WILL** get wiped (balance removed, ranks removed). **DO NOT STEP AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER WHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS ON.**
