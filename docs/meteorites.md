# Meteorites

Get there with **/warp mining**\
\
Meteorites are found in the [mining.md](worlds-dimensions/mining.md "mention") world, they fall from the sky from time to time.\
\
Keep an eye out for the meteorites in chat! There will be a message that pops up and tells you approximate coordinates of where the meteorite landed!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful! Meteorite's sometimes have barrels that are guarded by powerful mobs!\
Barrels contain special treasures such as [Ethereal Fragments](https://docs.playtheatria.com/ethereal-tools/ethereal-fragments), [Nether Stars](https://docs.playtheatria.com/economy/nether-stars) and other things like diamonds!
