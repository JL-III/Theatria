#### Commands:

* /sell hand - Sells the item you are holding for a value specified by the server
* /worth - shows the value of the item you are holding
* /balance, /bal - Displays your current balance
* /pay (player) - Pays a player from your balance
* /redeem - sells a Nugget of Denarii which is dropped from mobs when [Mob Hunting](https://docs.playtheatria.com/economy/mob-hunting)



**Note:**\
Not all items have /sell hand value. Some items are left to be completely player market based so that the players can determine what the values are to them.
