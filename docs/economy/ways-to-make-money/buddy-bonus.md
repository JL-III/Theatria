# Buddy Bonus

#### What is BuddyBonus?

BuddyBonus allows you to team up with a friend - your "Buddy" - and earn extra in-game currency just by playing together! The longer you stay paired up with your Buddy, the more you earn. It's a fantastic way to boost your earnings while enjoying Theatria's adventures with a friend. ü§ù‚ú®

10 mins together = 2x multiplier\
20 mins together = 3x multiplier\
And so on, up to 5x!

**Check Status**: Use `/buddy` to see your current Buddy and `/buddy notify` to toggle reward notifications.
