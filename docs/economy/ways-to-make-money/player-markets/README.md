# Player Markets

This is Theatria's central location for player shops (although you can create shops anywhere in [The Ark](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/the-ark)).

\
Use **/market** to get to the player market!\


**Requesting a market shop:**\
Open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz) to request a market shop.

\
Currently market shops are free but you do need to follow a set of rules that can be found here -> [market-shop-rules.md](market-shop-rules.md "mention")
