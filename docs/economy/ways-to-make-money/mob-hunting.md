# Mob Hunting

**Mob Hunting works in the following worlds:**\
[Mining](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/mining), [Nether](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/nether), [The\_End](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/the-end), and [Moon](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/moon)

**Commands:**

* /redeem

## How it works:

You must be in a world that mob hunting is turned on in. See above.\
When you kill a mob in one of these worlds they will drop a Nugget of Denarii. Nugget of Denarii are physical representations of our currency, you redeem them by using the command /redeem while holding the Nugget of Denarii.

#### Anti Grinding:

Mob Hunter is designed to be an active way of making money. For this reason, there are anti grinding features regarding the plugin. If you stay in one area for too long, you will stop receiving mob hunting rewards. To remedy this, simply move to another area and continue killing mobs.
