# Player Markets

This is Theatria's central location for player shops (although you can create shops anywhere in [The Ark](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/the-ark)).\
Use **/market** to get to Theatria. Theatria is the Capital of The Ark and the busiest place on the server. You can apply for a shop by pming a staff member!
