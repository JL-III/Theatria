# Ledger

\
Use **/ledger** in game to generate a session. Click the link in game to go to your ledger!\
Ledger links have expiration times. So after a while you will need to generate a new link in game with /ledger.

\
**Transaction Causes:**\
_Causes only show in a couple of ways due to the limitations of current economy plugins_

\
**API** - A plugin other than essentials triggered the transaction. (Chestshop, MobArena, Bags of denarii from mobhunter etc)\
**Unknown** - A plugin other than essentials triggered the transaction (Usually a penalty in Mobhunter for killing a wolf)\
**COMMAND\_SELL** _-_ This is triggered whenever you do /sell hand on an item\
**COMMAND\_ECO** - This is triggered in instances where you are given money from the server\
**HISTORICAL** - Transactions that occurred before the ledger was put into place\
