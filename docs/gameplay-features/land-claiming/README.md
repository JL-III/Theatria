Claiming land is an important feature on Theatria, allowing you to secure your builds and resources. Claims are made on a per-chunk basis (16x16 blocks), and you'll need in-game currency to claim land. Here's how to get started:

## How to Claim Land

1. Stand in the area you want to claim.
2. Use the command: `/claim`.

**Tip:** Try the command `/claim auto` to automatically claim chunks as you walk around! This is perfect for creating larger claims quickly and easily.

**Important Notes:**
- Claims are limited by [ranks](../ranks/README.md). To increase your claim limit, you can rank up!
- The initial cost per chunk is **$5000**.
- You can earn money through various activities detailed in the [Economy](../economy/README.md) section of the wiki.
