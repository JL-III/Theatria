# Mob Stacking

To optimize server performance and enhance gameplay, Theatria uses a mob stacking plugin in the **Mining World**. This system helps reduce lag by combining multiple mobs of the same type into a single "stacked" entity.

## How Mob Stacking Works

- When mobs spawn in the Mining World, they automatically stack together if they are of the same type and close to each other. 
- The stack is represented as a single mob with a number displayed above it, indicating how many mobs are in that stack.
- For example, if the number "10" appears above a mob, it means the stack contains 10 mobs.

## Interacting with Stacked Mobs

- **Killing a stacked mob:** When you kill one mob in the stack, the number decreases by one, and the stack remains until all mobs are defeated.
- **Using spawners:** If you place a spawner in the Mining World, mobs spawned from it will also stack. This ensures efficient farming while maintaining server performance.

## Benefits of Mob Stacking

- **Improved server performance:** By reducing the number of individual mobs, the plugin helps minimize lag, especially in areas with a high mob density.
- **Streamlined gameplay:** Players can still gather resources and XP efficiently without being overwhelmed by large numbers of individual mobs.
