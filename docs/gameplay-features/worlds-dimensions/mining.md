# Mining (resets monthly)

The mining world is a world that is **reset monthly** around the **1st of the month**. This world is for gathering resources and exists to keep The Ark from being used for resource gathering.\
The mining world also allows for the placement of [spawners](https://docs.playtheatria.com/spawners).\
Again, this world is **reset monthly** around the **1st of the month** so placing [spawners](https://docs.playtheatria.com/spawners) towards the beginning of the month is probably in your best interest. There are many aspects to [spawners](https://docs.playtheatria.com/spawners) that you should familiarize yourself with.
