# Titan Pack

The Titan Pack is Theatria's custom resource pack and is used for our custom items like [Titan Tools](./titan-tools/README.md).
If you want to use it and not have to do **/titan pack** everytime you join you can download it from [here](https://github.com/JL-III/TitanPack)
and install it like any other resource pack.

## How to install

1. Click to open Github page [here](https://github.com/JL-III/TitanPack)
2. Click on the releases on the right hand panel.
3. Click on the latest version. The file you're looking for will look something like this **TheatriaPackvX.X.X-X.X.zip**. This should start a download.
4. Open your **.minecraft** directory on your computer.
5. Add the zip file to your **.minecraft/resourcepacks directory**.
6. Launch Minecraft. When you are in game click on **options** and then click on **Resource Packs...**
7. Choose the version you just downloaded, double check your version since you might have several packs applied. Remove any old Theatria Resource Packs. If you have a resource pack you can't remove it is likely one applied via the command **/resourcepack** or **/titan pack**. Having this shouldn't cause issues but you can get rid of it by logging out and back in.
8. That should be everything! You can check with if the textures are loaded by looking at a **Titan Tool**.
9. Make sure to keep it upto date.
