# Kits

Kits are packages of rewards provided by the server. These rewards may include items, tools, or other benefits. Some player ranks and supporter ranks offer exclusive kits as a reward.

## How to Use Kits

To see which kits you currently have available, use the following command:

```
/kits
```

This will display a list of kits you can claim.

To claim a specific kit, type the following command, replacing `<name of kit>` with the name of the kit you want to claim:

```
/kit <name of kit>
```

For example, to claim the **rainstick** kit, type:

```
/kit rainstick
```

The **rainstick** kit gives you a rainstick item that makes it start raining in the game.

### Cooldowns
Most kits have cooldown periods before they can be used again. For example:

- The **rainstick** kit has a cooldown of **1 hour** and is available to all players.

Make sure to check the cooldown time for each kit to plan your usage.
