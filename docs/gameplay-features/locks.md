# Locks in Theatria

Locks are a powerful feature in Theatria that allow you to secure your items and spaces from other players. By using the `/lock` and `/unlock` commands, you can control access to chests, doors, and trapdoors, ensuring only you can open or interact with them.

## **How to Use Locks**

### Locking an Item
To lock a chest, door, or trapdoor:
1. Stand near the object you want to lock.
2. Type the following command:
   ```
   /lock
   ```
3. A confirmation message will appear, letting you know the object has been successfully locked.

Now, only you can open or use the locked object. Any other players attempting to access it will be denied.

### Unlocking an Item
If you decide to remove the lock:
1. Stand near the object you want to unlock.
2. Type the following command:
   ```
   /unlock
   ```
3. A confirmation message will appear, letting you know the object has been successfully unlocked.

Once unlocked, the object will be accessible to all players.

  - **Trapdoors**: Protect secret entrances or hidden areas.

## **Additional Notes**

- **Group Access**: Currently, locked items are player-specific, meaning only you can access them. If you'd like to share access with others, consider using [Land Claiming](./land-claiming.md) to claim the land and control access using roles and action flags.
- **Lock Removal by Admins**: In case of abandoned locks or disputes, server admins can manually remove locks. Contact a staff member if you need assistance.
- **Limitations**: Each player has a limit on the number of locked objects, based on rank. Review our list of [Ranks](../gameplay-features/ranks/README.md) to learn more.
