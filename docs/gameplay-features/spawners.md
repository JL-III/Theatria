# Spawners

Spawners are a valuable resource in Theatria, allowing players to generate specific mobs. Here's how you can obtain and use them effectively.

## How to Obtain Spawners

1. **Ranks**
   Unlock spawners through [ranks](ranks/ethereal-ranks), which can be purchased with in-game currency. Higher ranks often include better rewards.

## Placement Restrictions

- **Mining World Only**: Spawners can only be placed in the [Mining World](../worlds-dimensions/mining). 
- **World Reset**: The Mining World typically resets once a month, near the beginning of the month. Check the #announcements channel in our Discord server for updates.

## Tips

- Save spawners for strategic use when you plan to spend time in the Mining World.
- When you place a spawner in the Mining World, you can break it with a pickaxe. Using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch increases the chance of keeping and reusing the spawner.
