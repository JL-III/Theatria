# Spawners

Spawners are a valuable resource in Theatria, allowing players to generate specific mobs. Here's how you can obtain and use them effectively.

## How to Obtain Spawners

1. **Ranks**
   Unlock spawners through [Ranks](/ranks/mythic-ranks/01-hero.md) which can be purchased with Denarii, our in-game currency. Higher ranks often include better rewards.

## Placement Restrictions

- **Mining World Only**: Spawners can only be placed in the [Mining World](../worlds-dimensions/mining). 
- **World Reset**: The Mining World typically resets once a month, near the beginning of the month. Check the #announcements channel in our Discord server for updates.

## Tips

- Save spawners for strategic use when you plan to spend time in the Mining World.
- If you place a spawner in the Mining World, you can break it with a pickaxe. Using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch gives you a 75% chance of successfully picking it up. However, if you donâ€™t use Silk Touch, the spawner will be destroyed.
