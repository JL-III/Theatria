# Ethereal Items

Ethereal Items are powerful, one-of-a-kind items that you can purchase using [**Ethereal Fragment**](./ethereal-fragments.md). These items are highly sought after due to their unique abilities and overpowered (OP) stats.

## How to Obtain Ethereal Fragments

1. **Search for Meteorites**: Explore the Mining World to hunt for [meteorites](../../events-challenges/meteorites.md). These rare occurrences may contain special loot.

   - **Meteorite Barrels**: Rarely, meteorite barrels will include an [**Ethereal Fragment**](./ethereal-fragments.md) among their treasures.

2. **Collect and Trade**: Accumulate 16 Ethereal Fragments then open a stuff support ticket to trade them in for one Ethereal Item.
