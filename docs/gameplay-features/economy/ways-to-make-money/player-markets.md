# üè≠ Market Shops

This is Theatria's central location for player shops. While the Market is the main hub, you can also create shops anywhere in [The Ark](https://docs.playtheatria.com/worlds-dimensions/the-ark).

## Accessing the Market
Use the command **/market** to teleport to the player market.

## Requesting a Market Shop
To request a market shop, open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz). 

### Current Rules and Guidelines
Market shops are currently free to request, but all shop owners must follow the [Market Shop Rules](../rules-policies/market-shop-rules.md "mention").
