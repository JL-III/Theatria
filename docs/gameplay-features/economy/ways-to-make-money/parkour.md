# Parkour

Head to our Parkour hub and test your skills in various arenas! You can jump right into the action with a simple command or browse through the hub to find your favorite arena.

## Getting Started

- **Warp to the Hub:** Use `/warp parkour` to access the Parkour hub, where you can browse and select arenas.
- **Quick Start:** Type `/ajp start` to instantly begin a game in your most recently played arena.

In the hub, each arena is represented by a hologram. The hologram displays the arena's name, location, and difficulty level. To start, right-click the hologram of your chosen arena.

When the round begins, navigate a series of challenging jumps from block to block, avoiding falls at all costs. If you miss a jump, you'll be teleported back to the hub to try again or choose a new arena.

## Rewards and Leaderboards
