## How Does It Work?

### **1. Pair Up**
Use `/buddy add <name>` to send a buddy request. Your friend can accept the request with `/buddy accept`.

### **2. Stay Close**
To activate the bonuses, make sure you and your Buddy stay within **250 blocks** of each other.

### **3. Earn More**
Every 10 minutes spent near your Buddy increases your earnings multiplier, up to a maximum of 5x! Here's the breakdown:

- **10 minutes together** = 2x multiplier
- **20 minutes together** = 3x multiplier
- **30 minutes together** = 4x multiplier
- **40+ minutes together** = 5x multiplier

Buddy Bonuses start at **100 denarii per minute**, increasing as you and your Buddy keep playing together.

### **4. Check Your Status**
Use `/buddy` to see your current Buddy and your bonus status. Toggle reward notifications with `/buddy notify`.

### **5. End Your Buddy Pairing**
If needed, you can end the pairing with `/buddy remove`. Bonuses will stop once either player logs out or removes the pairing.
