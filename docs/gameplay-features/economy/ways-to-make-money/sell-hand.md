# Sell Hand Guide

This page explains how to sell items on the server, check item values, and avoid accidentally selling items you want to keep.

## Commands

### /sell hand
- **Description:** Sells the item you are currently holding for the value set by the server.
- **Usage:** Simply hold the item in your hand and type `/sell hand`.

### /sell all
- **Description:** Sells all sellable items in your inventory.
- **WARNING:** Be cautious when using this command, as it may sell items you did not intend to sell. Always double-check your inventory before using it.

### /worth
- **Description:** Displays the sell value of the item you are holding or the specified item.

#### Usage Examples:
- `/worth` – Shows the sell value of the item you are currently holding.
- `/worth [item]` – Tells you the value of a specific item.
  - Example: `/worth pumpkin` will display the /sell hand value for pumpkins.

## Important Notes

- **Named Items:** Items with custom names **cannot be sold**. If you wish to protect specific tools or items from being accidentally sold, give them a unique name.
  - To name an item, use an anvil and apply a name to the item.

By following these guidelines, you can safely manage your inventory and maximize your earnings on the server.
