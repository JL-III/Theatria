# Ban Appeals

Title: Ban Appeals

If you have been banned from Theatria and believe that your ban was unjust or that you deserve a second chance, you can submit a ban appeal. Theatria's ban appeal process is designed to be fair and transparent, giving all players the opportunity to have their case heard and considered by multiple staff members.

Ban Appeal Process:

1. Submit your ban appeal through the appropriate form or channel, providing all necessary information such as your username, reason for the ban, and a detailed explanation of why you believe the ban should be lifted.
2. Your appeal will be reviewed by our staff team, who will consider the circumstances of your ban and your explanation. Please be patient as this process may take some time.
3. For a ban appeal to be approved, at least three staff members must agree to lift the ban. This includes the server owner, who has an equal say in the decision-making process. Disapprovals from any staff member, including the owner, will not impact the outcome as long as three approvals are received.
4. You will be notified of the decision on your ban appeal. If your appeal is approved, your ban will be lifted, and you will be allowed to rejoin the server. If your appeal is denied, you may be given the opportunity to submit another appeal after a specified period.
