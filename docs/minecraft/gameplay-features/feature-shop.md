# 🛒 Feature Shop

The **Feature Shop** is Theatria's online store, hosted through [Tebex](https://theatrian-market.tebex.io/), where players can support the server through donations. These donations directly fund advertisements to help grow Theatria's community while maintaining a fair and balanced gameplay experience.

## What is the Feature Shop?

The Feature Shop offers a variety of items and perks designed with **pay-to-win (P2W) prevention** in mind. This ensures that Theatria stays true to its promise of providing a fair, inclusive, and enjoyable environment for all players, regardless of their financial contributions.

### Examples of Available Features:

* **Support Rank Recognition:** Show off your support with exclusive ranks displayed both in Discord and in-game, highlighting your contributions to Theatria.
* **Sunfish & Nightfish:** Take control of time with these unique items, allowing you to change day to night or night to day in your current world.
* **Flight Access:** Unlock the ability to use '/fly' in The Ark and the Mining World for unparalleled exploration and efficiency.
* **Server-Wide McMMO Boosts:** Activate 4x McMMO experience for everyone on the server, lasting either four or eight hours, depending on your purchase level.
* **Vanish Mode:** Disappear from view with the '/vanish' command, perfect for moments when you want to remain unseen while online.

> **Note:** All features are carefully balanced to ensure they do not disrupt the core gameplay or create an unfair advantage for paying players.
