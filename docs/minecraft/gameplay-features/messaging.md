# ✉️ Messaging

Theatria provides a few ways to communicate with other players.

## Global chat

* By default you'll chat in this channel, which broadcasts to all online players. If you ever leave the Global channel, you can return by typing `/ch join Global`.

## Local chat

* You can switch to the Local channel with `/ch join Local`. This broadcasts to the players in your immediate vicinity. Also try turning on our [Buddy Bonus](../../gameplay-features/economy/buddy-bonus.md) feature for extra Denarii while you're near others.

## Private chat

`/msg <PlayerName>`: begin a private message session with an online player. End the session by typing `/msg` `/msg <PlayerName> <your message here>`: send a single message to an online player. `/r <your message here>`: send a reply to the most recent private message you received.

## Server email

`/mail`: view all commands for server email. `/mail send <PlayerName> <your message here>`: send an in-game mail message to another player. They will be alerted to the message the next time they login. `/mail read`: begin reading your server email.
