# 👾 Custom Mob Rules

Theatria features several custom rules for mob behavior to create a balanced and enjoyable gameplay experience across its worlds. Below are the key tweaks you should know about:

## Phantoms

* **Where they spawn**: Phantoms only spawn in the **Mining World**, making it a key area for gathering phantom-related drops.
* **No Phantoms in The Ark**: To maintain a safe and peaceful environment, phantoms do not spawn in **The Ark**.

## Mob Griefing

* **Environment protection**: In the **Mining World**, mob griefing is disabled:
  * **Creepers**: Their explosions harm mobs and players but do not cause damage to the environment.
  * **Endermen**: Endermen cannot pick up or move blocks, preserving the integrity of the terrain.

## Difficulty Settings

* The **Mining World** operates on **Hard difficulty**, offering a challenging experience for players seeking greater risk and reward.

These tweaks ensure that gameplay remains dynamic and engaging while minimizing unnecessary frustration. Happy exploring!
