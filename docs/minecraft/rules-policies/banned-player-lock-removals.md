# 🔓 Banned Player Lock Removals

## Temporary Bans

**Locks that belong to temporarily banned players are not eligible for removal while their ban is active.**\
This means they remain protected by the **/seen** rule outlined in [claim-maintenance-and-expiration.md](claim-maintenance-and-expiration.md "mention").

## All Other Bans

Players banned for reasons other than temporary bans have one week to [submit an appeal](ban-appeals/) before their locks are eligible for removal.

A player's locks cannot be removed during:

* The initial one-week appeal window.
* Any time during which their appeal is under consideration.

To request lock removal after these periods, open a ticket in our Discord as outlined in [technical-help.md](../../faqs-troubleshooting/technical-help.md "mention").
