## About Hytale Theatria

Founded on Jan 13, 2026, Hytale Theatria is a Hytale server dedicated to providing players with a space to build, create, and explore.\
\
Unlike our Minecraft server we are not able to promise no resets. Hytale is still in it's early development.\
\
At Theatria, we prioritize fairness and accessibility, ensuring all players, regardless of financial background, can enjoy a level playing field.
