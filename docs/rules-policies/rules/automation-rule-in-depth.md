# Automation Rule In Depth

{% hint style="danger" %}
Automation includes _any method_ that allows you to bypass **manual gameplay**, including the use of **Minecraft’s own mechanics**.\
This means:

❌ **You must manually kill mobs**—using methods like entity cramming, lava traps, pistons, or similar setups to automatically kill mobs and collect drops _without your active participation_ is not allowed.

The core principle is **you must be actively playing** to earn rewards.

If you’re ever unsure whether a setup is allowed, please ask staff. We’re here to help, and no one will be punished for seeking clarity.
{% endhint %}

Redstone mechanisms are allowed, primarily for non-monetary uses such as:

* Auto-smelters
* Door mechanisms
* Item sorters

If you have questions about what is allowed, feel free to open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz) in Discord. We are happy to help clarify any concerns.

{% hint style="danger" %}
