# Automation Rule in Depth

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Automation for collecting drops or making money is NOT ALLOWED.**
{% endhint %}

Redstone mechanisms are allowed, primarily for non-monetary uses such as:
- Auto-smelters
- Door mechanisms
- Item sorters

If you have questions about what is allowed, feel free to open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz) in Discord. We are happy to help clarify any concerns.

- **SUGAR_CANE**
- **BAMBOO**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Anyone caught automating money-making methods risks severe penalties, including:
- **Account wipe** (balance and ranks removed)
- **Audit** (investigation into money distribution and earnings)

**JUST DON'T DO IT.**
{% endhint %}
