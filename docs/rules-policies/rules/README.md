# Theatria Server Rules

Welcome to Theatria! Our community thrives when everyone follows these rules to create a fun, fair, and welcoming environment.  

## 1. Maintain a Respectful Environment
Treat all members with respect, and avoid using vulgar or offensive language. Discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. We want everyone to feel welcome!  

## 2. Be Kind, No Trolling
**DO NOT** intentionally provoke or upset others through actions or comments. Help us create a positive atmosphere for all players.  

## 3. No Griefing
**DO NOT** destroy, damage, steal from, or alter other players' protected builds without their permission. Respect the hard work and creativity of others.  

## 4. Keep Content Appropriate
Offensive names, skins, structures, bios, and usernames are not allowed. Avoid political conversations, as they can lead to conflicts and disrupt the community's focus. Let’s keep things **fun and enjoyable** for everyone!  
> If this rule seems unclear or problematic, our server might not be the best fit for you.  

## 5. Do Not Promote Other Servers
Please don’t promote or share information about other servers, either in-game or on Discord. Let’s focus on building our community.  

## 6. Do Not Spam
Avoid sending repetitive or excessive messages in text or voice channels to ensure a better experience for everyone.  

## 7. Follow Moderation Decisions
If you are muted or moderated, respect the decision and avoid attempting to bypass it. Trust our staff to maintain a safe and fun environment. Address concerns through proper channels.  

## 8. No IRL Trading
**DO NOT** trade real-life items for in-game items. This keeps things fair for everyone.  

## 9. Manual Farming Only
Automated farming methods are not allowed to ensure balanced gameplay.

## 12. Alt Account Rules
Alt accounts have limitations, such as not being able to rank up or earn `/daily-rewards`, to ensure fairness for all players.  

## 13. Report Rule Violations Responsibly
If you notice a rule violation, PM a staff member with evidence. **DO NOT** discuss it in public channels.  

## 14. Stay Active to Keep Your Claims
