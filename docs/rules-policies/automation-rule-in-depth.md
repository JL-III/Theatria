# Automation Rule in Depth

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Automation for collecting drops or making money is NOT ALLOWED.**
{% endhint %}

Red stone mechanisms are allowed, primarily they are used for things like auto-smelters, door mechanisms, sorters etc.&#x20;

If you have questions on what is allowed always feel free to open a [staff support ticket](https://discord.gg/hFJWRDKyNz) in discord, we are happy to help clarify anything.\

The following items are blacklisted for hoppers and pistons (meaning they will not work):

* PUMPKIN
* MELON
* SUGAR\_CANE
* BAMBOO
* CACTUS
* WHEAT

{% hint style="danger" %}
Anyone who is caught automating money making methods is at risk of an account wipe (balance removed, ranks removed) and audit (investigation into money distribution and earnings). **JUST DON'T DO IT**
{% endhint %}
