# Banned Player Lock Removals

## Temporary Bans

**Locks that belong to temporarily banned players are not eligible for removal while their ban is active.**  
This means they remain protected by the **/seen** rule outlined in [Claim Maintenance and Expiration Notice](../land-claiming/claim-maintenance-and-expiration-notice.md "mention").

## All Other Bans

Players banned for reasons other than temporary bans have one week to [submit an appeal](ban-appeals.md) before their locks are eligible for removal.

A player's locks cannot be removed during:

- The initial one-week appeal window.
- Any time during which their appeal is under consideration.

To request lock removal after these periods, open a ticket in our Discord as outlined in [Technical Help](../faqs-troubleshooting/technical-help.md "mention").
