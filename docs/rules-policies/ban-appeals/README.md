# Ban Appeals

If you have been banned from Theatria and believe that your ban was unjust or that you deserve a second chance, you can submit a ban appeal. Theatria's ban appeal process is designed to be fair and transparent, giving all players the opportunity to have their case heard and considered by multiple staff members.

## Ban Appeal Process

1. **Submit Your Appeal**
   - Use the appropriate form or channel to submit your ban appeal.
   - Provide the following information:
     - Your in-game username.
     - The reason for your ban.
     - A detailed explanation of why you believe the ban should be lifted.

2. **Staff Review**
   - Your appeal will be reviewed by our staff team. They follow these [Ban Appeal Review Guidelines](./ban-appeal-review-guidelines.md).
   - Staff members will consider the circumstances of your ban and your explanation.
   - Please be patient, as this process may take some time.

3. **Approval Criteria**
   - At least **three staff members** must agree to lift the ban for the appeal to be approved.
   - The server owner is included in this process and has an equal vote.
   - Disapprovals from any staff member, including the owner, will not impact the outcome if three approvals are received.

4. **Notification of Decision**
   - You will be informed of the outcome of your appeal.
   - If your appeal is approved, your ban will be lifted, and you will be allowed to rejoin the server.
   - If your appeal is denied, you may be given the opportunity to submit another appeal after a specified period.
