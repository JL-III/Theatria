# Block Restrictions

To ensure the integrity and stability of our server, we have certain server-wide restrictions on specific blocks. These restrictions are in place to prevent potential exploitation and discourage practices that could negatively impact server performance.

## Server-Wide Restricted Block

- **Slime Block**: Slime Blocks are restricted server-wide due to potential exploits and the possibility of creating machines that can cause server instability.

### Why Do We Restrict Blocks?

The aim of these restrictions is to ensure fair gameplay for all players and to maintain a healthy server environment. Limiting the use of certain blocks helps us prevent:

- Server lag caused by automated or complex contraptions.
- Exploits that could give unfair advantages to players.
- Unintended disruptions to the serverâ€™s functionality.
