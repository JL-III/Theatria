# The Ark Restrictions

In order to promote fair gameplay and a balanced server environment, we have implemented certain restrictions on a number of blocks and items in The Ark. This step helps prevent exploitation of in-game mechanics, ensuring that all players earn their progress through effort and skill, rather than through the use of automated systems or other exploitations.

## Restricted Blocks and Items

The following items and blocks are not permitted in The Ark:

### Movement-related Items

- Slime Block

---

## Other Block Restrictions, by dimension

- **Mining** [Restrictions](mining-restrictions.md)
- **Nether** [Restrictions](./nether-restrictions.md)
- **The End** [Restrictions](./the-end-restrictions.md)
