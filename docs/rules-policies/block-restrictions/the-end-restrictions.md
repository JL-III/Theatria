# The End Restrictions

Our server policies strive to ensure fair gameplay and a healthy server environment. To prevent potential exploitation of game mechanics and server lag, several block restrictions have been implemented in The End. The restricted blocks are listed below:

### Redstone-Related Items

* **Hopper Minecart**
* **Observer**
* **Piston and Sticky Piston**
* **Hopper**

### Movement-Related Items

* **Slime Block**

### Decoration-Related Items

* **Armor Stand**
* **Item Frame**

### Other Items

* **Soul Sand**

These restrictions are set in place to preserve the integrity and performance of the server. We discourage any form of automation in The End, and focus should be on exploration and combat. Before planning any activities in The End, please refer to this list.
